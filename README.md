## Features

- Visualize sorting algorithms in action.
- Generate random arrays to sort.
- Choose from various sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
- Control the visualization speed to observe the sorting process.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.

## Installation

To use the Sorting Visualizer locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/iamshivanshyadav/Sortiva.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:


3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

That's it! You can now use the Sorting Visualizer.

## Usage

1. Open the Sorting Visualizer in your web browser.
2. Click on the "Generate Array" button to generate a random array.
3. Select a sorting algorithm from the "Sort Algorithm" dropdown menu.
4. Choose the size of the array from the "Array Size" dropdown menu.
5. Adjust the speed of the visualization using the "Speed" dropdown menu.
6. Click the "SORT" button to start the visualization.
7. Observe the sorting process and the changes in the array's visual representation.
8. Once the sorting is complete, the array will be sorted, and the visualization will stop.

## Sorting Algorithms

The Sorting Visualizer supports the following sorting algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort

Each algorithm has its own approach to sorting the array and is visualized accordingly.
